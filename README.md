# WEB1010 Final Exam

Consider the page at http://swolebrain.com/clients-samples/world-intl-security/

Start a new github repository and download the whole site onto it.

## PART 1

1. Print 'clicked on logo' to the console when the user clicks on the logo in the navbar.
2. The div with class 'mission-content' is hidden with CSS. Use JavaScript to
   show/reveal/toggle the div with class 'mission-content' when the user
   clicks on the anchor that says 'Our Mission'. Make sure you prevent the default
   anchor behavior, which moves the page to the href attribute's value.
3. Repeat step 2, but for the div with class 'services-content' and the
   'Our Services' anchor.
4. Create a form with 3 inputs and a submit button. The inputs should have the
   following attributes:
    1. type should be "text"; name should be "name"
    2. type should be "email"; name should be "email"
    3. type should be "tel"; name should "phone"
5. Using jQuery's ajax method, post the form data to fvi-grad.com:4004/fakeform. Make
   sure you prevent the form's default behavior of reloading the page.
6. Change the form button's content (its word) to 'Message Sent!' after the form
   successfully sends. If the form fails to send, change the form button's contents
   to 'Error sending message'.
